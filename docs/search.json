I am also the University’s Lead for Research Integrity and Improvement. I joined Keele in 2010 after completing my PhD at Bangor University under the supervision of Dr George Houghton.\nThe mission of my lab’s work is to conduct rigorous fundamental research to understand cognitive control processes, and to then use this knowledge to tackle clinical and applied questions. I utilise behavioural measures together with computational modelling to address my research questions.\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n PhD Cognitive Psychology, 2010\n\n\nBangor University, UK\n\n\n MSc Psychological Research, 2007\n\n\nBangor University, UK\n\n\n BSc Psychology, 2006\n\n\nBangor University, UK"
