### About
<p class="topbr">
I am a Reader in Cognitive Psychology at [Keele University, UK](https://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/) where I am the Research Group Lead for the Cognition, Brain, & Behaviour group in the School. I am also the University Academic Lead for Resarch Integrity and Improvement. I joined Keele in 2010 after completing my PhD at Bangor University under the supervision of [Dr George Houghton.](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/psychology/people/profiles/george_houghton.php.en)

The mission of my lab\'s work is to conduct rigorous fundamental research to understand cognitive control processes, and to then use this knowledge to tackle clinical and applied questions. I utilise behavioural measures together with computational modelling to address my research questions.
