### About
<p class="topbr">
I am a [Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_(academic_rank)) in Cognitive Psychology at [Keele University, UK](https://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/) and Director of Research for the School of Psychology. I am also the University's Lead for Research Integrity and Improvement. I joined Keele in 2010 after completing my PhD at Bangor University under the supervision of [Dr George Houghton.](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/psychology/people/profiles/george_houghton.php.en)

The mission of my lab's work is to conduct rigorous fundamental research to understand cognitive control processes, and to then use this knowledge to tackle clinical and applied questions. I utilise behavioural measures together with computational modelling to address my research questions.
