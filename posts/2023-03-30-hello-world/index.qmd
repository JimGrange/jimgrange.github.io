Hello world! This is, of course, a test. Based on [this excellent blog post](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/)

Here is some example code:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(123)

data <- tibble(
  outcome = rnorm(1000), 
  predictor = rnorm(1000))
data
```

And here's the resulting plot:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = outcome, y = predictor)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, 
             colour = "skyblue") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Outcome variable", 
       y = "Predictor variable")
```
