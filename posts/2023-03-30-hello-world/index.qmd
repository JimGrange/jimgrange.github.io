Hello world! This is, of course, a test!
---

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(123)

data <- tibble(
  outcome = rnorm(1000), 
  predictor = rnorm(1000)
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = outcome, y = predictor)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, 
             colour = "skyblue") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Outcome variable", 
       y = "Predictor variable")
data
```
