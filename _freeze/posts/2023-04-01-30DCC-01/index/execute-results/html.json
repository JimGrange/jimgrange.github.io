It's a \"...community-driven event with the goal to create a data visualization on a certain topic each day of April\". Each day you're provided a prompt and using any tools you develop a data visualization.\n\n![](prompts.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nI think this would be a great way to learn some new R `tidyverse` and `tidymodelling` skills so thought I'd give it a try. I am not sure how many days I will be able to keep it up, but day one was fun.\n\n## Overview\n\nToday's prompt was \"part-to-whole\". I will be honest, I didn't know what was meant by a \"part-to-whole\" data visualisation, so I did what all the cool kids are doing these days and I asked Chat-GPT:\n\n![](01-gpt.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"75%\"}\n\nOK, that's a little clearer. What is more clear is that I am **not** going to do a pie chart! But first I need some data.\n\n## Ultrarunning & Eating\n\nSince the UK lockdown in March 2020 I've caught the running bug. Last year, I completed my first marathon, and I have signed up to two marathons this year. The marathon is---obviously---a tough distance; but some (crazy) people run *Ultra*-marathons which is any race longer than the 26.2 miles of a standard marathon.\n\nIf you're training for an ultra-marathon, you probably want to make sure your diet during your training is good to ensure you are getting the necessary nutrients and energy. It's not untypical for ultra-runners to consume anywhere between 3,000 to 6,000 calories a day during training. As for macro-nutrient recommendations, the guidelines for ultra-runners are not very different from those for other endurance athletes. The general recommendation for endurance athletes is as follows:\n\n-   **Carbohydrates:** 45-65% of total daily calories.\n-   **Protein:** 15-20% of total daily calories.\n-   **Fats:** 20-35% of total daily calories.\n\nLet's say you're interested in making a daily log of your total daily calorie intake together with tracking your macro-nutrients. For each day, how did each of the macro-nutrients (i.e., the *part*) contribute to total calorie intake (i.e., the *whole*)?\n\n## Simulating the data\n\nFirst let's load the required packages and do a general set-up:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\" code-summary=\"Code\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's simulate data for the month of April 2023. For each day, we log/generate the following data:\n\n-   **date**: Date of the daily log\n-   **day:** What was the day of the week? We might be interested how macros and total calories varies by day of the week.\n-   **calories_total:** Simulate total daily calorie intake. For this we assume a normal distribution with mean of 3,000 calories and a standard deviation of 250.\n-   **prop_carbs:** For each day, what is the proportion of total calories made up from carbohydrates. As this is a proportion, for each day we generate a random number between 0.45 and 0.65.\n-   **prop_protein:** For each day, what is the proportion of total calories made up from protein? For each day we generate a random number between 0.15 and 0.20.\n-   **prop_fat:** For each day, what is the proportion of total calories made up from fat? As the proportions for each macro-nutrient need to sum to 1, fat is just 1 minus prop_carbs and prop_protein.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# simulate the data\nset.seed(123)\n\ndata <- tibble(\n  date = lubridate::ymd(paste(\"2023-04-\", 1:30, sep = \"\")), \n  day = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE), \n  calories_total = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 3000, sd = 250), \n  prop_carbs = runif(n = 30, min = 0.45, max = 0.65), \n  prop_protein = runif(n = 30, min = 0.15, max = 0.20), \n  prop_fat = 1 - (prop_carbs + prop_protein)\n  )\ndata\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 30 × 6\n   date       day   calories_total prop_carbs prop_protein prop_fat\n   <date>     <ord>          <dbl>      <dbl>        <dbl>    <dbl>\n 1 2023-04-01 Sat            2860.      0.583        0.157    0.260\n 2 2023-04-02 Sun            2942.      0.469        0.183    0.348\n 3 2023-04-03 Mon            3390.      0.527        0.167    0.306\n 4 2023-04-04 Tue            3018.      0.505        0.183    0.312\n 5 2023-04-05 Wed            3032.      0.613        0.166    0.221\n 6 2023-04-06 Thu            3429.      0.540        0.159    0.301\n 7 2023-04-07 Fri            3115.      0.612        0.189    0.199\n 8 2023-04-08 Sat            2684.      0.612        0.155    0.233\n 9 2023-04-09 Sun            2828.      0.609        0.173    0.218\n10 2023-04-10 Mon            2889.      0.538        0.176    0.286\n# … with 20 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can then use these proportions for each macro to calculate how many of the day's total calories were from carbohydrates, protein, and fats.

Not really useful for a part-to-whole visualisation (ha! Suddenly I'm a know-it-all on part-to-whole visualisations), but here it is anyway:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbar <- data %>% \n  filter(source != \"total\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value, group = source)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = source), \n           position = \"dodge\") + \n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y =\"Calories Consumed\", \n       fill = NULL)\nbar\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNot bad, but it's hard to differentiate the different days during the month.\n\n### Stacked column plot\n\nA stacked column plot is similar to the bar plot but the bars are---you guessed it---stacked on top of each other:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstacked_column <- data %>% \n  filter(source != \"total\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = source)) + \n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y =\"Calories Consumed\", \n       fill = NULL)\nstacked_column\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is clearly better than the bar plot. One useful aspect of this plot is that we get multiple points of information: The height of each column shows the total calories consumed (the whole), and the colours represent the macros that make up that total (the part). It's very basic, but it's functional.\n\n### Polar plot\n\nI am not sure if this is the correct term for it, but you can wrap the column plot around polar coordinates using `coord_polar()` in ggplot. This makes it look snazzier, but I am not sure it is more informative.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolar <- data %>% \n  filter(source != \"total\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = source)) + \n  coord_polar() +\n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y =\"Calories Consumed\", \n       fill = NULL)\npolar\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's definitely snazzier, and you still retain a feel for the total calories consumed each day. It is harder to ready the y-axis (calories consumed) for each point, and whilst we're at it the x-axis (date) isn't that clear either.\n\nWe also get an idea of the macro contributions to the total, but in the current plot this isn't completely satisfactory because it's hard to visualise the category with the smallest proportion (protein). To address this we can reverse the ordering on the `geom_col()` call using the `position` argument so that the category with the smallest contribution is on the outer section of each column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolar_reversed <- data %>% \n  filter(source != \"total\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = source), \n           position = position_stack(reverse = TRUE)) + \n  coord_polar() +\n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y =\"Calories Consumed\", \n       fill = NULL)\npolar_reversed\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere they are all next to each other:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(patchwork)\n(bar + stacked_column) / (polar + polar_reversed)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Grouping by day\n\nMaybe you want to log how your macros vary on average by day. To do this, we group our data by the day of the week and calculate averages for each day and plot these. We need to briefly go back to wide data to calculate the relevant averages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nday_data <- data %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = source, values_from = value) %>% \n  group_by(day) %>% \n  summarise(carbs = mean(carbs), \n            protein = mean(protein), \n            fat = mean(fat)) %>% \n  pivot_longer(carbs:fat, names_to = \"source\")\nday_data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 21 × 3\n   day   source  value\n   <ord> <chr>   <dbl>\n 1 Sun   carbs   1575.\n 2 Sun   protein  536.\n 3 Sun   fat      943.\n 4 Mon   carbs   1674.\n 5 Mon   protein  560.\n 6 Mon   fat      821.\n 7 Tue   carbs   1571.\n 8 Tue   protein  532.\n 9 Tue   fat      816.\n10 Wed   carbs   1669.\n# … with 11 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nday_data %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = value)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = source), \n           position = position_stack(reverse = TRUE)) + \n  coord_polar() +\n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y =\"Calories Consumed\", \n       fill = NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Grouping by month and day\n\nSo you're really keen and you've logged your calorie intake daily throughout all of 2023.
